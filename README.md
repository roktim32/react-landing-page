# Landing Page

Welcome to the Landing Page repository! This project showcases a modern and responsive landing page built using React and Vite. With a focus on performance and developer experience, this landing page template can be easily customized to suit your project's needs.

## Features

- **React and Vite:** This landing page is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Vite, a fast build tool that optimizes development experience.

- **Responsive Design:** The landing page is designed to look great on various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.

- **Easy Customization:** You can easily customize the content, styles, and images to match your brand or project requirements.

- **Optimized Performance:** The use of Vite ensures fast development and build times, resulting in a performant landing page.
